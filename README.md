Internal employee directory

# Requirements:
1. The demo should be implemented using Laravel 5, MySQL, and Bootstrap.
2. We would like an internal employee directory so all of our employees can search our database of 10,000 employees
3. We would like employees to be able to log in and be able to search the database
4. We would like any employee to be able to add/edit/delete other employees

A typical directory entry has the following information:
    * Name
    * Job Title
    * Location
    * Email
